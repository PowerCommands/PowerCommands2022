# Power Commands
You could see PowerCommands as your CLI application starter kit. It is a structured framework for creating your own customized command prompt to perform tasks with the full control from your command environment. That means no time-consuming hassling with a GUI, try catch block, validate your input, you do not need to write a zilion test classes either. Just concentrate on the code, create your commands and run the Console application.
