# POWERCOMMANDS DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND GUIDLINES
# Design principles
 The design principles for this project is to keep the Core lightweight and simple. The Core components is components that you probably or very often will use, while Custom Components do not have that characteristic feature. Another restriction for the Core components is that they should avoid to add any third party dependancies, that way you know exactly what code you are running.

The core components should be reliable and robust and do not change much over time. That statement applies from the day when the project has reached 1.0 status, the current staus I would say is 0.5, hopefully the core part of this project reach level 1.0 before the end of this year (2022). 
 
 Custom component are aloud to break that rule, custom components should on the other hand avoid to have depandencies to the Core components, they should be design to work as stand-alone components.

 # CREATE YOUR OWN POWER COMMANDS IMPLEMENTATION

 Before we dig ourselves in to details about how we create a PowerCommands Implementation, a short breafing about the basics is in place...

 The items in the purple boxes is the most interesting part when you are setting upp a new implementation.
 
## <a name='PowerCommandConsolee'></a>PowerCommand Consolee
### <a name='KeeptheConsoleappliakationascleanaspossiblee'></a>Keep the Console appliakation as clean as possiblee
 The console application should be used as is so that the look and feel of Power Commands is consistent, be restrictive in implementing your own custom code here, use the Bootstrap or the Command project(s) instead.

 The default PowerCommand Console contains two lines only.
 
 ```
 Console.WriteLine("Power Commands 1.0");
 PainKiller.PowerCommands.Bootstrap.Startup.ConfigureServices().Run(args);
 ```
 
 Simple guidline is, donÂ´t do anything except maybe change the title, it could be practical, over time you could have many different implementations.

## <a name='Bootstrapcomponent'></a>Bootstrap component
The bootstrap component is the glue between the Console and the other modules, it has a Startup class whos purpose is to initialize the application and customize its behavoiur if you want to. The main class to edit is in that case the PowerCommandsManager class.

## <a name='Yourcustomcommandsprojects'></a>Your custom commands project(s)
The whole purpose of PowerCommands framework is so that you can write your own commands, and every implementation must therefore have at least one project containing this commands. This project also needs a couple of mandatory classes, simply copy the classes from the "MyExampleCommands" project in this github repository.
[My Example Commands](https://github.com/PowerCommands/PowerCommands2022/tree/main/src/PainKiller.PowerCommands/PainKiller.PowerCommands.MyExampleCommands)
The files needed is:
 - PowerCommandServices   
 - PowerCommandsConfiguration
 - PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml*

 *Needed at runtime is the configuration file PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml, and your custom commands project is the most suitable project for this file.

 Each file explained:
### <a name='PowerCommandServicess'></a>PowerCommandServicess
 The main service class that contains all the main services for the framework, this services are.
 - ExtendedConfiguration
 - Diagnostic
 - Runtime
 - Logger
 - ReadLineService

 So if you want to swap a service for something else, for example the Logger component, here is the place to do that.

### <a name='PowerCommandsConfiguration'></a>PowerCommandsConfiguration
This class purpose is to maket it easy for you to extend the configuration with your own elements, if you do not need that, just leave the class empty.

```
public class PowerCommandsConfiguration : CommandsConfiguration
{
    //Here is the placeholder for your custom configuration, you need to add the change to the PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml file as well
}
```
If you want to extend the configuration, it could look something like this: (code from the Example project)
```
public class PowerCommandsConfiguration : CommandsConfiguration
{
    //Here is the placeholder for your custom configuration, you need to add the change to the PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml file as well
    public string DefaultGitRepositoryPath { get; set; } = "C:\\repos";
    public FavoriteConfiguration[] Favorites { get; set; } = new[] {new FavoriteConfiguration {Name = "Music", NameOfExecutable = "spotify"}, new FavoriteConfiguration { Name = "Games", NameOfExecutable = "steam" } };
}
```
The configuration element class FavoriteConfiguration  must of course be added, place the file in a directory named Configuration. (just a naming convetion guidline)

## <a name='PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml'></a>PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml
You should have this file in one of the projects and the Commands or the Console project is suitable for that, the configuration file is needed at runtime by the Console application. If you customize the PowerCommandsConfiguration class you also need to add this in the yaml configuration file so that the application can use it, same is also true when removing stuff, they should be in sync with each other.

A default base configuration file looks like this, format is YAML:
```
version: 1.0
configuration:  
  codeEditor: C:\Users\guest\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe  
  showDiagnosticInformation: false
  metadata:
    name: Example Commands
    description: Example project
  log:
    fileName: powercommands.log
    filePath: logs
    rollingIntervall: Day
    restrictedToMinimumLevel: Information
    component: PainKiller.SerilogExtensions.dll
    checksum: 173831af7e77b8bd33e32fce0b4e646d
    name: Serialog
  components:
  - component: PainKiller.PowerCommands.Core.dll
    checksum: 30cc55b7c6f29f951be3df97f634fb71
    name: PainKiller Core
  - component: PainKiller.PowerCommands.MyExampleCommands.dll
    checksum: c8d128cde99a5ee06b56e8337c10b1e2
    name: My Example Command  
```

### <a name='MorethenonePowerCommandprojectinthesameimplemantationnoproblembut...'></a>More then one PowerCommand project in the same implemantation? (no problem but...)
If your PowerCommand implementation contains more then one PowerCommands project only one of them should contain this classes, it dosent matter wich one.

## <a name='CreateyourfirstHelloWorldCommandd'></a>Create your first Hello World Commandd
  - Clone this repo
  - Open the Solution PainKiller.PowerCommands in the src\PainKiller.PowerCommands folder.
  - Make sure that one of the Console project is marked as startup project, for example the **PainKiller.PowerCommands.PowerCommandsConsole** in the Solution root
  - Build the solution to make sure that the PowerCommandsConfig.yaml file is created in output folder
  - Start the application and run the command new [name] "[Path to directory]"
  - Follow the instructions to initialize your new solution and do a test run.  

Now you are ready to create your very first Command!

### <a name='Helloworldexample..'></a>Hello world example..
```
using PainKiller.PowerCommands.MyExampleCommands.Configuration;
namespace PainKiller.PowerCommands.MyExampleCommands.Commands;
public class ExampleCommand : CommandBase<PowerCommandsConfiguration>
{
    public ExampleCommand(string identifier, PowerCommandsConfiguration configuration) : base(identifier, configuration)
    {

    }

    public override RunResult Run(CommandLineInput input)
    {
        WriteLine("Hello world");
        return CreateRunResult(input);
    }
}
```
This is the bare minimum that you need, to learn more about what you could do, look at sample commands in the Examaples project in this github repositorys.

## <a name='DesignofyourCommands'></a>Design of your Commands
 Think of your command as an one line command with some parameters in a cmd prompt environment, it should do a single isolated task, for example lets say you want to convert yaml file to json or xml. A good name could be **ConvertCommand**, as parameters you have a path to the input file, and a flag for the format and a value to that flag. That is a pretty good design for one Command. 
 
 The usage of this command will look like this if I want to convert my yaml fil to json.

```convert "C:\temp\myYaml.yaml" --format json```

If you want the input to be more self described you can choose to add a flag for the filepath like this:

```convert --file "C:\temp\myYaml.yaml" --format json```
 
There are other ways you can solve the design to, you can solve it with two Commands instead, one command named **XmlCommand** and another named **JsonCommand**, it is all up to you.

You could look here for inspiration:

## <a name='ExtendPowerCommand'></a>Extend PowerCommand

### <a name='AvoidchangesinthePowerCommandCoreextendinstead'></a>Avoid changes in the PowerCommand Core, extend instead
 PowerCommand Framework is distributed as open source code on Github, if you use the source code, avoid to change anything extend the functionallity instead if you feel that you need to do that. That way it is easier for you when something has changed in the Core.
### <a name='Writegenericcustommodules'></a>Write generic custom modules
Keep the Command classes and project lightweight, create custom modules if what you are about to solve means a lot of business and data logic, a good example is the custom command GlitchFinder in this repository. With Glitchfinder you could compare datasources with each other. The implementation is divided in two parts, in the custom module all the algoritms is placed that actually do the comparison and regression test, the Commands project is just a administrative "client" you could say, where you could organise the usage of this test and keep track of the results.

# NAMING CONVENTIONS
## <a name='Reflection'></a>Reflection
PowerCommands rely on reflection to find all existing PowerCommands that are valid runnable commands, to make this work some naming convention rules are used:
 - **A valid PowerCommand class name should end with "Command"**
 
   For example RenameCommand or SendMailCommand otherwise they will be ignored by the runtime and could not be used.
 - **Base Commands**
 
   Some base PowerCommands exists in Core, their name ends with "Base" and are defined as abstract and intended to be inherited by other PowerCommands classes, use the same pattern if you add commands with the purpose of acting as base classes.

## <a name='ReservedCommandnamess'></a>Reserved Command namess
 As the name of the PowerCommand class is used as an identifier, their name must be uniquee, this are the core Commands that you should not use in your custom PowerCommands project, at the moment the reserved commands names are:
 - CommandsCommand
 - ClsCommand
 - LogCommand
 - SecretCommand
 - ExitCommand
 - DescribeCommand

 This could of cours change in the future and the documentation may not be updated, you could easliy check the reserved commands using this command in the Console:

 ```
 commands ! 
 ``` 
## <a name='Directoriess'></a>Directoriess
 Guidlines for naming directories
 - **Contracts** contains interfaces 
 - **Managers** contains business logic classes with the postfix Manager, for exemple DiagnosticManager, ReflectionManager
 - **Services** contains static och or Singleton classes acting as services to Managers or Commands
 - **Enums** contain Enums
 - **BaseClasses** contains base classes
 - **Commands** contain valid PowerCommand classes
 - **DomainObjects** contain simple classes for data transfer (POCO, DTO, Record), could contain subdirectories for different domains
 - **Extensions** contains extensions classes
 - **Events** contain custom events
 - **Exceptions** contais custom exceptions  

# SECURITY
## <a name='Storesecretsoutsidetheapplicationpath'></a>Store secrets outside the application path
 PowerCommands handles export and imports of environment variables using YAML files it is the preferred way to store secrets. Do not store sensitive information inside the application path as it will be to easy to steal with a simple copy and paste operation, sensitive information should always be encrypted at rest.

## <a name='Usethesecretsbuiltinfunctionallity'></a>Use the secrets built in functionallity 
Create secret with built in commands named secret, like this:
```
secret create "localDB"
```
This will create a secret item in configuration, and a encryptet secret will be stored in a EnvironmentVariable with the proviede name.
In you command you could get the decrypted secret like this.
```
var cn = Configuration.Secret.DecryptSecret("Server=.;Database=timelineLocalDB;User Id=sa;Password=##localDB##;"); 
```
Sometimes you have to pass a configuration element to a thirdparty or custom module, then this could be usefull, it creates a new clone of the configuration and you pass that, its a good pattern ratcher then pass the runtime configuration instance that could lead to unpredictable result and in worst case revealing the decrypted secret by mistake.
```
var decryptedCloneConfiguration = Configuration.Secret.DecryptSecret(config.SourceSetting, nameof(config.SourceSetting.ConnectionString));
```
You pass in the configuration and the property name that has a tagged secret and you get a clone of the configuration back where the property value decrypted. In the example above it is the **ConnectionString** property that is decrypted.

## <a name='Becarefullwhendecryptingbesuretoprotectyoursecretsinruntime'></a>Be carefull when decrypting, be sure to protect your secrets in runtime
It is very easy to expose a decrypted value by mistake, the decryption should be in the same scope or in very near scope of the usage. It should not be passed around with the other configuration values and reside in runtime as long as the application executes. The risk is that for example the decrypted value is logged for some reason you cant predict and the secret is logged as clear text, in other words it is revealed and must be changed.

### <a name='RecomendedpatternforcustomCompenentsusingsecretspasstheDecryptSecretfunction'></a>Recomended pattern for custom Compenents using secrets, pass the DecryptSecret function
A pattern to reduce this risk could be to send the DecryptSecret function to the target rather then send the decrypted configuration, like this example below. In this real world use case I using a Custom Component, I want to implement the secret handling as late as possible but avoid to create a depandancy between the custom component and PowerCommands. I have to modify the Custom component a bit but no dependancy is needed. 
```
//First I add this to the class in the custom component that will use the connction string.
private static Func<string, string> _decryptSecretsFunc;
public static void SetDecryptSecretFunction(Func<string, string> decryptSecretsFunc) => _decryptSecretsFunc = decryptSecretsFunc;

//In the same class when the connection string needs to be decrypted the function will be invoked.
var cnString = _decryptSecretsFunc == null ? dss.ConnectionString : _decryptSecretsFunc.Invoke(dss.ConnectionString);
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(cnString))

//From the PowerCommand class you need to pass the DecryptSecret function like this
SqlImport.SetDecryptSecretFunction(Configuration.Secret.DecryptSecret);
```
# LOGGING
## <a name='Reducecoadbloatbyavoidingtryandcatch'></a>Reduce coad bloat by avoiding try and catch
No need for try catch in PowerCommands Run method as the call already is encapsulated in a try catch block, to reduce coad bload let custom code just crasch and handle that by the PowerCommands runtime, it will be logged, it will be presented for the user in a generic way that not reveal sensitive informaiton that could be the case if you just use Console.WriteLine(ex.Message).
## <a name='Reducecoadbloatbyavoidinglogging'></a>Reduce coad bloat by avoiding logging
The runtime always logg information about the input and output from a PowerCommand execution, if you want to pass information from the PowerCommand to the log, you could use Output to to that.
Every time you use a Write method in the Commands class, this will be added to the Output and logged as soon as the method is finished. 
```
var name = $"{input.SingleArgument} {input.SingleQuote}";
WriteLine($"Hello {name}");
```
This will add a row to the log with the output from the WriteLine call automatically.
## <a name='UseCommandBaseWritemethods'></a>Use CommandBase Write methods
The CommandBase class has a couple of help methods to output data to the console, use that rather then Console.WriteLine. The base class Write methods will automatically return all the output during a Run method execution, and this output will be logged by the logger component.
```
WriteHeadLine("Header", addToOutput: true);
WriteLine("Write line, also ends up in the log (default behaivour)");
WriteProcessLog("Write with WriteProcessLog adds a tag do log","process1");
//You could also use extensions methods
this.WriteObjectDescription(name:"Megabytes", description:"A numeric value");
```
## <a name='ButIreallywanttowritetothelogdirectlyinmyCommandclass'></a>But? I really want to write to the log directly in my Command class!
It is something that is not encouraged, quite the opposite but in some cases you may need to do that, and you can (using an extension method).
```
IPowerCommandServices.DefaultInstance?.Logger.LogInformation($"Log this information please");
```
# CONFIGURATION
## <a name='UseYAML'></a>Use YAML
 The PowerCommands.Configuration component has generic support for reading and writing object as YAML and that format should always be used for configuration files. 
## <a name='Configurationcouldbesharedbyclients'></a>Configuration could be shared by clients
The main configuration should be named PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml and be a valid YAML file, it could be shared by many clients residing in the same directory.
In such cases they should support the identical configuration structure otherwise there could be trouble, most propably some Console client wonÂ´t start.

# Documentation
## <a name='UseMarkdownformat'></a>Use Markdown format
 The format of dokumentation in text should use the markdown format.
## <a name='AlwaysdescribeyourPowerCommands'></a>Always describe your PowerCommands
 Be kind to your consumer as it often turn out to be you that are the consumer, fill in a shourt description of what the PowerCommand is doing and how to use it.
## <a name='UseTagsandPowerCommandattributes'></a>Use Tags and PowerCommand attributes
This is an example where every property of the attributes is used

![Alt text](attributes.png?raw=true "Attributes")
Attributes is used to show a nice description of the command with the built in describe command.

```
describe cls
```
![Alt text](describe.png?raw=true "Describe")

Tags attribute is used to make searches with the commands command.

```
commands tag "help"
```
