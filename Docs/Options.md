# Options

Options is what the name implies, options for your command, lets have a look at this example below.

You could also se that this Command has two options separated with pipe **"path|format"**, first one named **path** and the other one is **format**. This will give the user autocomplete feedback when typing - and using the [Tab] tangent.

Programatically you can use Options in two ways, you could grab the value, wich is the parameter typed after the option, like this (using the RegressionCommand as example, it is a user created command).

``` convert --path "C:\temp\test.yaml" --format json```

To get the value of the **mode** option you code like this:

``` var path = input.GetOptionValue("path"); ```

Sometimes you just want a option without a value, you can solve that like this:

``` var encrypt = input.HasOption("encrypt"); ```

## Validation of mandatory option and value
The option can trigger validation of **required value** and/or **mandatory** meaning the option is not optional. 

- A starting **!** means that the option must have a value if the user adds it to the input, but it is still optional.
- **UPPERCASE** option name means that the option must be included by the user input, but value is not required unless the option starts with the **!** symbol.

The example below shows how the path option is both mandatory an requires a value.

[PowerCommandDesign(  description: "Converting yaml format to json or xml format",
                          options: "!PATH|format",
                          example: "//Convert to json format|convert --path \"c:\\temp\\test.yaml\" --format json|//Convert to xml format|convert --path \"c:\\temp\\test.yaml\" --format xml")]
```
## The CommandBase class holds a list of the declared options with the input value
That is another way to programatically work with the options.

### Do not use the help option, unless you want to override itÂ´s behaviour
It will not harm anything but --help will trigger the Core frameowork to display generic help (using the PowerCommandDesign attriute).
You can override this behaviour if you set the property **overrideHelpOption** to true. Do not do that if your not intend to implement your own show help functionalllity for that command.
