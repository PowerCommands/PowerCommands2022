# Configuration

## PowerCommandsConfiguration.Yaml
The content in these file has two parts, the first part is the core configuration, that part all PowerCommand application has.
Second part is the extended configuration parts, this part is optional if you need custom configuration you need to implement this by your self. The content of this part is then merged into one configuration file. 

## The base configuration class diagram:

## Properties

### BackupPath
The path to use by a command that needs to store backups of any kind, the Core framework uses the backup for itÂ´s internal [documentation index](DocumentationIndexDB.md).

The Example project on Github has extended the configuration and will therefore be the use case for this documentation.

### CodeEditor
The path to your favorite code editor, that you could start with the ConfigCommand, this command is shipping with the creation of new PowerCommand Visual Studio solution.

### Command design overrides
You can override some of the values that are set in the **PowerCommandsDesignAttribute**, read more about this [here](OverrideDesignAttribute.md)

### Components
Here you declare those dll components that the Core framework will use to find all available Commands.

## Environment
Environment variables that the application needs to be aware about.

## Log
Details about the logging.

## Metadata
Description about your PowerCommand project.

## Repository
URL to this repository, used internally to create new VS solutions and Commands using PowerCommands application.

## Secret
Name of secrets that the application needs to be aware about, each secret has an corresponding environment value that is encrypted.

## ShowDiagnosticInformation
Enable or disable the display of diagnostic output.
