# Implementations
 
## KnowledgeDB
 A very simple but powerfull application for you to build a knowledge DB adding Url:s, Directory pats and links to One Note documents and enriching them with tags wich makes them more searcheble, I use this PowerCommands implementation every day in my job as an IT-architect.

 ## GlitchFinder power commands using GlitchFinder component by Jooachim

 Either compare two different datasets or compare a single dataset towards itself over time.
 If there are glitches in the matrix then you get a report showing lines that are missing or different in the two datasets. 

You can use it in two different ways.

**Comparison**

This is for comparing two different data sources, could be two different files, two different DB queries, one file vs one query etc.

**Regression test**

This is for tracking a single dataset/source over time. You create a baseline, which is stored on file, and then later compare data towards this baseline.
