# Templates

## Standard template

[PowerCommands.zip](PowerCommands.zip)

Copy the .zip file into the user project template directory. By default, this directory is **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio <version>\Templates\ProjectTemplates** (do not place it in any of the subfolders).

Open Visual Studio and write Power in the searchbox, you should find the PowerCommand template.

## DevOps template
This one [PowerCommands_DevOps.zip](PowerCommands_devops.zip) has a couple of commands that lets you run kubectl, docker and powershell commands just as you would do from a standard **cmdprompt**.
