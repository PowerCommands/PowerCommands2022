# Templates

## Standard template

[PowerCommands.zip](PowerCommands.zip)

Copy the .zip file into the user project template directory. By default, this directory is **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio <version>\Templates\ProjectTemplates** (do not place it in any of the sub folders).

Open Visual Studio and write Power in the searchbox, you should find the PowerCommand template.

I recommend you to use the option ```Place solution in the same directory``` some experimental features for update and create commands using a template the Core depends on that.

### Capability to Run PowerCommand with a service account and using secrets
If you want to run your PowerCommands application as a Windows scheduled task started by a service accounts that is not allowed to login on the machine, you need to do a couple of steps.

- You need to copy the PainKiller directory from your %User%\AppData\Roaming to the corresponding one for the service account. 
- Copy the environment variable _encryptionManager and create the same as a system environment variable. EncryptionService will look for the system environment variable if the user environment variable is not there. 
- For your stored secrets you will need to to do the same thing and change target: User to target: Machine in the **PowerCommandsConfiguration.yaml** file.
### Improved logging
Every log post now includes the current user running the PowerCommand application, the Log commands has been re-designed to use suggestions instead of options where more appropriate.
